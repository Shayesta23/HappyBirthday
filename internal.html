You're funny, mature, peaceful, agressive, positive and a person filled with passion to strive and live for. You deserve all the love in this world and one day you'll have everything you prayed for. The best life In Sha Allah. May Allah grant a long life to your parents for raising such a dedicated, humble man. (Aameen). Umr lambi ho aapki bhi.
